    "description":"HEART 0033# üêÆ 1/5  \n\nHeart is a intrepid and cunning. \n\nAs it is an animal with specific signs that are difficult to inherit, it was not intended to leave it as a bull, but precisely these signs give it a particularity that can be attractive to collectors. It is unique for having a white spot on its head that in contrast to its red covering stamps a red heart on its forehead. The arrangement of its white spots on the belly and especially on the head makes it rare because it is easily identifiable in the herd.. \n\nhe is normal with humans. The relationship with the herd is  herd behavior. \n\nFollow Heart life on the [website model 33]( https://thelivestock.live/model-33/)  \n\nMore information about the NFT: \n\nEdition: 1st of 5 \n\nEthereum blockchain (ERC-1155) \n\nSize:500x500 \n\nModel year: 2021 \n\nPhotographer: Fiora \n\nYou are also entitled to a commercial license, read the terms [here]( https://thelivestock.live/digital-collectible-terms/). \n\n Unlockable content [here](https://thelivestock.live/unlockable-content/).",
