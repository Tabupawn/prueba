    "description":"WINTER 0003# üêÆ 1/5  \n\nShe replaces Tammy who was sold to get fat. Winter is a curious and quiet. \n\nAlthough it is not seen at first glance, it has a white cloak on its belly. She is a female with a very good constitution and has a lot of potential as a mother. Her first few months were difficult for her genesis mothers due to an intense drought, but she was able to grow up healthy. Like her sisters, she was going to be sold in feedlots, but TheLiveStock rescued her from that cruel fate.. \n\nShe is great with humans. The relationship with the herd is  herd behavior. \n\nFollow Winter life on the [website model 3]( https://thelivestock.live/model-3/)  \n\nMore information about the NFT: \n\nEdition: 1/5 \n\nEthereum blockchain (ERC-1155) \n\nSize:500x500 \n\nModel year: 2021 \n\nPhotographer: Fiora \n\nYou are also entitled to a commercial license, read the terms [here]( https://thelivestock.live/digital-collectible-terms/). \n\n Unlockable content [here](https://thelivestock.live/unlockable-content/).",
