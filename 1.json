    "description":"JUDY 0025# üêÆ 1/5 \n\nJudy is a different and nonconformist. \n\nShe is a graceful female but she is not pretty in spite of it, many times for the ranchers they are the most loved because she ends up being excellent mothers. Her first few months were difficult for her genesis mothers due to an intense drought, but she was able to grow up healthy. Like her sisters, she was going to be sold in feedlots, but TheLiveStock rescued her from that cruel fate.. \n\nShe is good with humans. The relationship with the herd is  herd behavior. \n\nFollow Judy life on the [website model 25]( https://thelivestock.live/model-25/)  \n\nMore information about the NFT: \n\nEdition: 1st of 5 \n\nEthereum blockchain (ERC-1155) \n\nSize:500x500 \n\nModel year: 2021 \n\nPhotographer: Fiora \n\nYou are also entitled to a commercial license, read the terms [here]( https://thelivestock.live/digital-collectible-terms/). \n\n Unlockable content [here](https://thelivestock.live/unlockable-content/).",
