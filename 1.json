     "description":"DORIS 0012# üêÆ 1/5 \n\nDoris is a curious and cunning. \n\nHer first months were difficult for her genesis mothers due to an intense drought, but she was able to grow up healthy. Like her sisters, she was going to be sold in feedlots, but TheLiveStock rescued her from that cruel fate. Her white chin gives her a unique touch that sets her apart from the rest from a distance.. \n\nShe is good with humans. The relationship with the herd is  herd behavior. \n\nFollow Doris life on the [website model 12]( https://thelivestock.live/model-12/)  \n\nMore information about the NFT: \n\nEdition: 1st of 5 \n\nEthereum blockchain (ERC-1155) \n\nSize:500x500 \n\nModel year: 2021 \n\nPhotographer: Fiora \n\nYou are also entitled to a commercial license, read the terms [here]( https://thelivestock.live/digital-collectible-terms/). \n\n Unlockable content [here](https://thelivestock.live/unlockable-content/).",
