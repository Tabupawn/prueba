    "description":"Anwen is a beautifull and intelligent. \n\nThe Limangus breed has the calving ease of the Limousin (native to France) and the fertility and hardiness of the Aberdeen Angus (native to Scotland). He eliminated the undesirable characteristics of the original breeds to preserve the virtues of both Limousin and Angus. Thus, an intermediate biotype was created, rustic and fertile, with good potential for growth and development of significant muscle mass.. \n\nShe is good with humans. The relationship with the herd is  herd behavior. \n\nFollow Anwen life on the [website model 6]( https://thelivestock.live/model-6/)  \n\nMore information about the NFT: \n\nEdition: 1st of 5 \n\nEthereum blockchain (ERC-1155) \n\nSize:500x500 \n\nModel year: 2021 \n\nPhotographer: Fiora \n\nYou are also entitled to a commercial license, read the terms [here]( https://thelivestock.live/digital-collectible-terms/). \n\n Unlockable content [here](https://thelivestock.live/unlockable-content/).",
